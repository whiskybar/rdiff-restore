rdiff-restore
-------------

A simple restore GUI for the rdiff-backup used at tele3.cz. It will have
an ability to restore a database or a directory. Download or restore
in-place. Logged in users only and only within a scope of the logged in
domain.

Merely an excercise for Bootstrap, AngularJS, and Flask.
